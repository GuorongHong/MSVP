## Problem Statement
Through the use of a web application, we aim to tackle security issues faced by internet users in using variations of a single simple password across various online platforms, allowing users to use complex and unique passwords across their multiple accounts while at the same time storing them in a safe, secure space.

## Solution
We intend to develop a web application equipped with user login and authentication, with CRUD functionality for users to store, edit and retrieve passwords. The stored passwords would be encrypted and when commanded by the user, capable of being decrypted and retrieved. Thus, only requiring a master password to gain access to these encrypted passwords, this web app intends to simplify the process of managing passwords while keeping them secure. In addition, the web app would be capable of generating and suggesting a secure, complex password.
